To test the `ElasticDefend` rule you've mentioned, you'll need to create a PowerShell script that includes references to encryption/decryption functionality, specifically using the classes and methods that are part of the rule query. The rule looks for PowerShell scripts containing cryptographic operations, particularly those involving the `AESManaged`, `RijndaelManaged`, and related cryptography classes, along with methods such as `.CreateEncryptor` and `.CreateDecryptor`.

Here is an example of a PowerShell script you can use to test this rule:

```powershell
# PowerShell script to test encryption/decryption rule

# Load necessary cryptography namespaces
Add-Type -TypeDefinition @"
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

public class CryptoHelper {
    public static string Encrypt(string plainText, string key, string iv) {
        using (Aes aesAlg = Aes.Create()) {
            aesAlg.Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key);
            aesAlg.IV = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(iv);
            ICryptoTransform encryptor = aesAlg.CreateEncryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);
            
            using (System.IO.MemoryStream msEncrypt = new System.IO.MemoryStream()) {
                using (CryptoStream csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write)) {
                    using (System.IO.StreamWriter swEncrypt = new System.IO.StreamWriter(csEncrypt)) {
                        swEncrypt.Write(plainText);
                    }
                }
                return Convert.ToBase64String(msEncrypt.ToArray());
            }
        }
    }

    public static string Decrypt(string cipherText, string key, string iv) {
        using (Aes aesAlg = Aes.Create()) {
            aesAlg.Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key);
            aesAlg.IV = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(iv);
            ICryptoTransform decryptor = aesAlg.CreateDecryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);
            
            using (System.IO.MemoryStream msDecrypt = new System.IO.MemoryStream(Convert.FromBase64String(cipherText))) {
                using (CryptoStream csDecrypt = new CryptoStream(msDecrypt, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read)) {
                    using (System.IO.StreamReader srDecrypt = new System.IO.StreamReader(csDecrypt)) {
                        return srDecrypt.ReadToEnd();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
"@ -Language CSharp

# Test encryption and decryption
$key = "1234567890123456"  # 16-byte key for AES
$iv = "1234567890123456"   # 16-byte IV for AES
$plainText = "This is a secret message."

# Encrypt the message
$encryptedText = [CryptoHelper]::Encrypt($plainText, $key, $iv)
Write-Host "Encrypted: $encryptedText"

# Decrypt the message
$decryptedText = [CryptoHelper]::Decrypt($encryptedText, $key, $iv)
Write-Host "Decrypted: $decryptedText"

# Additional code to invoke CreateEncryptor and CreateDecryptor
$aes = [System.Security.Cryptography.AesManaged]::new()
$encryptor = $aes.CreateEncryptor($aes.Key, $aes.IV)
$decryptor = $aes.CreateDecryptor($aes.Key, $aes.IV)
Write-Host "Encryptor and Decryptor created."
```

### Explanation:

- **Encryption and Decryption**: The script uses AES encryption and decryption, which corresponds to the cryptographic classes in the rule query (`AESManaged`, `RijndaelManaged`, etc.). The script includes both encryption (`CreateEncryptor`) and decryption (`CreateDecryptor`) operations.
- **Testing the Rule**: The script first encrypts a string and then decrypts it. The rule you're testing looks for the presence of encryption/decryption operations in PowerShell script block text, which this script does.
- **Classes**: `Aes.Create()` and `AesManaged` are used, which match the query criteria.

### Notes:

1. **Avoiding Exclusion**: The rule contains a condition that excludes certain files based on file names (`Bootstrap.Octopus.FunctionAppenderContext.ps1`) and function names (`Decrypt-Variables`). Ensure your test script doesn't inadvertently match those exclusions unless intended.
2. **Key and IV**: In the script, I've used a fixed 16-byte key and IV for simplicity. In real-world scenarios, you would generate a secure key and IV, but for testing purposes, this works fine.
3. **Script Execution**: When you run this script on a Windows host with the appropriate configuration for ElasticDefend to monitor, the rule should trigger if the script runs and contains the relevant cryptographic operations.

### Running the Test:

Execute the script in a PowerShell terminal or script file. If your `ElasticDefend` system is monitoring for these patterns, it should detect the execution of cryptographic operations and generate an alert based on your query
